GenericEnum
===========

Retrieve Enum name from a string, int or parameter

This example doesn't take in count Enums that does have only name or doesn't have parameters
Isn't a very elegant solution, though it's good for use if you have several enums and as example if you have a string
and want to know the constant name, it's good. 
Good examples is for when extracting from SOAP those static values and convert it to Enum.
The last update you can get the enum even if the enum values doesn't have a parameter and using string.
Also I have updated the project to have packages.
Please see the com.kv.genericenum.test.MyMainClass.java for examples.
