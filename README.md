GenericEnum
===========

Retrieve Enum name from a string, int or parameter

This example doesn't take in count Enums that does have only name or doesn't have parameters
Isn't a very elegant solution, though it's good for use if you have several enums and as example if you have a string
and want to know the constant name, it's good. 
Good examples is for when extracting from SOAP those static values and convert it to Enum.
